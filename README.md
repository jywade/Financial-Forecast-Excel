In this project, I went through the process of calculating summary statistics, drawing an inference from the statistics, calculating business metrics and using models to forecast future growth prospects for the companies. The goal was to perform an analysis and also create visual tools to communicate the results in an informative way.

# Question 1: Was the average annual growth rate of the NYSE sector Healthcare higher than Consumer Discretionary between 2014 & 2016?
# Question 2: How did they compare in total revenue between this period?

Given the NYSE dataset, I prepared by isolating the two NYSE sectors and and calculating the summary statistics between 2014 and 2016 such as Measures of Center, Measures of Spread, and Five Number Summary.

After calculation of the summary statistics and determining the shape of the data, I utilized Pivot Tables to analyze and compare the Total revenue, average total revenue, revenue per year, and average revenue per year. I then isolated certain parts of my analysis and visualized using column charts.

Moving forward, with the data I had, I used this to calculate the growth rates of each NYSE sector for 2015 and 2016 and then calculated the averages.

After this analysis, I then had the answer to my questions and was rady to begin forecasting and creating a financial model with weak case, base case, and best case scenarios. 
I utilized VLOOKUP function to create a dynamic Profit & Loss statement for each NYSE company with the usage of data validation dropdown list.

I then created a financial model for AFLAC with three possible scenarios and visualized it dynamically.

I assembled and interpreted my finding in a PowerPoint presentation.
