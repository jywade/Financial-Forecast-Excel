In this project, I went through the process of calculating summary statistics, drawing an inference from the statistics, calculating business metrics and using models to forecast future growth prospects for the companies. The goal was to perform an analysis and also create visual tools to communicate the results in an informative way.

Given the dataset of NYSE I used pivot tables, to create and isolate certain parts of the data.
